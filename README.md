# numericalmethods105 repository
This repository is of the matlab programs that hsve been written for the CSU MECH 105 class on numerical methods. In this repository can be found programs that have ben used in class as well as the functions written by both the writers of the book "Applied Numerical Methods (4th edition)" by Steven C. Chapra and this student John R.F. Kelly. These functions focus on understanding and applying numerical analysys methods learned in this book. A detailed explanation of the real matlab functions can be found in the matlab code, but some of these files are simply experimenting with matlab to solve homework questions.
The files Homework_1_<#> are files to solve spesific problems from the homework and as such are simple programs.
The file hewns_simple.m is a simple single iteration of Hewn's method to solve a spesific function. This is a file I intend to turn into a full function that can take inputs and inital condition that will iterate to a set number or a set error.
The files matlab_grader_<HW#> are some more simple functions and files that were used for homework solutions.
The function small.m is a simple function to divide by 2 to find how small of a number can a computer calculate untill it rounds down to zero.
The file smallest_number.m is a program to determine how small a decimal can still be used with a whole number
